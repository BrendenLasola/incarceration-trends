Introduction and Summary

This data set looks at the prison data of the United States of America. My idea of prison's is very simple, bad guys go to prison. Most countries believe in this philosphy but in the USA, the prison system is a business with a corrupt/racists background. Vera institute gathered data from various different places, and I wanted to personally look at data pertaining the midwest and Alabama. I wanted to specifically do a state and a region, to see how things change based on scale. 

In the midwest I wanted to look at the differences between people in jail vs the total population in black and white people. I did this simiarly with one of my charts but it looks at Alabama instead. I wanted to look at this type of data set for each region because I wanted to see if there was a difference based on reagion or if it was more the same across the US. Specifically looking at the Illinois, there are over 5 million white people but a little bit over 5000 in Jail in 2018 while there are over 8000 black people in jail with a population of a million. Looking at this data there is a severe difference in population between black and white people in Illinois but there are more black people in jail compared to white people. In Illinois the mean amount of black people in jail per county is 83. This data shows that there is a disproportionate amount of black people in jail when looking at their overall population. 

The line chart that I provided looked at the amount of people in jail based on race. Looking at the line chart it looked like it was even comparing white people and black people. Just looking at the population of black people in jail, it is gradual while white people in jail had a sharper incline. White people in jail had the mast amount of people based on race but also it resembled the total population graph in terms of shape. Looking at the data set it may seem like black and white people are equally being put into jail but looking at the amount of white people and and black people there are, the picture changes completely.  This can be proven again by the scatter plot of the midwest ratio of black people's in jail vs not in jail who are ages 15 to 64 compared to the data of white people's, also showed this same idea. Looking at the scatter plot, it is clear that black people have a higher percentage of people that are in jail compared to white people. I wanted to include tis plot to clearly show the difference in the ration of people in jail vs not when it comes to black and white people.
