# Incarceration trends in the USA

## Overview
This dataset is provided by vera institute, it has different statistics about the incarceration rates in the US. The codebook had a lot of interesting stats and data on incarceration rates but I specifically wanted to see if there was a racial bias towards black people in the USA. One thing to note is that this topic has multiple factors to take into account, just looking at incarceration trends in the USA is not strong enough to prove there is a racial implicit bias towards black people. 

Some problem's I experienced with this dataset is that there were a lot of null values, especially going all the way back. There were data for population but not specificly by race. I tried to focus on years that did have a majority of the data to make an overall picture of what is happening in the United States. 


###  Total Population over Time

One thing I want to highlight is the fact that our population has increased dramatically over the years. We have had just generally more people than ever before, looking at the graph it is a very positive slope. There weren't a lot of dips in population. So the overall Jail and Prison rates should mirror the population graph or somewhat look like it. Another thing to take into account is the fact that the US has largest private prison population in the world. There were some private prison statistics in this dataset but I would like to compare it to other countries to really see if there is a big difference in private prison population or not. 

### Jail and Prison Over Time

Like I mentioned earlier, it is safe to say that the overall rates of going into prison/jail has increased over the years. It is concerning that the overall slope of prison rates is higher than jail rates. There has always been more people in prison than jail in the US but the gap has widen by a lot over the years. 
There was also a slight deep recently in the jail rates. 

### Incarceration rates over time based on race

I did not include aapi or natives in this graph because they were so low in terms of everything else that it didn't really affect the graph. Overall the graph does show's that white and black people make majority of the jail population with latinx as third. There has been a recent uptick in the incarceration of white people  compared to black people. One thing to take into account here is that there are way more white people in the USA compared to black people. It is actually insane that earlier on black people were being incarcerated at the same rate and even more in some years than white people. 

### Percentage of total population for each race in Jail

### Percentage of total population for each race in Prison

With the two previous bar graphs what I wanted to showcase is the fact that there is a largest percentage of black people in prison and jail compared to white people. In terms of prison population there is a more percentage of black, native, and latinx population in jail. I wanted to really look at this stat because of the fact that white people outnumber every other race by a very large margin. This isn't really enough to show that there is a bias towards black people or other races in general in the incarceration system in the United States but it is very eye opening to see how things currently are.
