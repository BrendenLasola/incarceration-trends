# incarceration-trends
## Overview
One of the sharpest manifestations of racism in the United States is its prison system. A complex set of social and political structures, including the over-policing (Links to an external site.) of individuals of color and the war on drugs (Links to an external site.) have led to the disproportionate incarceration of people of color. These issues are very well summarized in the documentary 13th, which you can watch for free (Links to an external site.).

In this assignment, you will use your data analysis and visualization skills to expose patterns of inequality using incarceration data collected by the Vera Institute (Links to an external site.). In doing so, you will:

Work with a real world, messy dataset
Choose your own direction for analysis, including which variables to analyze and compare
Design and build compelling visualizations to expose particular patterns in the data
Create a website (using RMarkdown) to share your results
This assignment is more open-ended than previous ones -- you will be tasked with understanding the data itself, choosing the variables you want to analyze, and deciding the optimal way to write your code.
